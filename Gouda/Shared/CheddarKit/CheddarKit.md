#  CheddarKit

CheddarKit is meant to be a small api sdk library thing that connects to Cheddar's API and handles all of that stuff for you. Preferrably I'd like it to provide convenience methods for storing Cheddar based data locally too. Ultimately it's a library of functions and methods with suggestions on how to use it.
